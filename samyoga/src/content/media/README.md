# Media Content

This folder contains JSON files that list media items (images and videos).

The main file is `media.json` which includes:
- Gallery images with metadata
- Video listings with metadata
- Descriptions and captions

Media files themselves should be placed in:
- `/public/assets/images/landscape/` or `/portrait/`
- `/public/assets/videos/landscape/` or `/portrait/`

This JSON file references those assets.
