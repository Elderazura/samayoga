Yoga, at its core, is about finding balance. Not just physical balance—though that's part of it—but a deeper equilibrium between movement and stillness, effort and ease, action and rest.

## The Dance of Movement

Hatha yoga invites us into movement. Through asanas, we explore our bodies, challenge our edges, and build strength and flexibility. This is the active practice—the yang energy that helps us feel alive, capable, and connected to our physical form.

But movement in yoga is never just about the body. As we flow from pose to pose, we're also moving our awareness. We're learning to pay attention, to stay present, to notice what's happening in this moment.

## The Power of Stillness

Yin yoga offers us stillness. In those long, supported holds, we're not trying to do anything. We're simply being. This is the receptive practice—the yin energy that allows us to settle, to release, to let go.

Stillness doesn't mean emptiness. It means creating space—space to feel, to observe, to rest. It's in this stillness that we often discover what we've been too busy to notice.

## Finding Your Balance

The beauty of yoga is that it teaches us to honor both. Some days, we need movement—to wake up the body, to move energy, to feel our strength. Other days, we need stillness—to rest, to reflect, to restore.

There's no right or wrong here. Just awareness. Just the gentle practice of listening to what you need in this moment, and offering it to yourself with kindness.

## Bringing It Off the Mat

This balance isn't just for the mat. It's for life. Movement and stillness, action and rest, doing and being—we need both. Yoga teaches us to recognize when we've tipped too far in one direction, and how to gently return to center.

So the next time you come to your mat, ask yourself: what do I need today? Movement or stillness? And know that whatever the answer, it's exactly right.
