One of the most common questions I hear is: "How do I stay consistent with my yoga practice?" The answer is simpler than most people think, and gentler than many expect.

## Start Small

You don't need to practice for an hour every day. In fact, starting small is often the key to building a practice that lasts.

**Start with 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times per week.** That's it. That's enough. In fact, it's more than enough.

Why? Because consistency isn't about the length of your practice—it's about showing up regularly. A 10-minute practice three times a week is far more valuable than a 60-minute practice once a month.

## Make It Easy

The best practice is the one you'll actually do. So make it as easy as possible to get on your mat.

- Roll out your mat in the morning so it's ready when you are
- Have a few go-to sequences you can do without thinking
- Choose a time that works for your schedule, not what you think you "should" do
- Keep it simple—you don't need fancy props or complicated sequences

## Release the "All or Nothing" Mindset

Many people fall into the trap of thinking: "If I can't practice for an hour, why bother?" This all-or-nothing mindset is the enemy of consistency.

**Something is always better than nothing.** Five minutes counts. Ten minutes counts. A few stretches before bed counts.

Yoga isn't about perfection or duration. It's about presence and intention. Even the shortest practice can be meaningful if you're fully there.

## Create a Gentle Structure

While you don't need rigid rules, having a loose structure can help. For example:

- **Monday**: Hatha practice (20 minutes)
- **Wednesday**: Yin practice (15 minutes)
- **Friday**: Gentle movement (10 minutes)

This gives you a rhythm without feeling restrictive. Adjust as needed.

## Be Kind to Yourself

Life happens. You'll miss days. That's okay. The practice isn't about never missing a day—it's about coming back when you do.

Don't let one missed day become a week. Don't let one week become a month. Just come back. Your mat will always be there, with no judgment.

## Celebrate Small Wins

Notice what's working. Did you practice twice this week? Celebrate that. Did you roll out your mat even when you didn't feel like it? That's a win.

Building a consistent practice is a journey, not a destination. Every time you show up, you're strengthening not just your body, but your commitment to yourself.

Remember: yoga is a practice, not a performance. Be patient. Be kind. And most of all, keep showing up—even if it's just for 10 minutes.
