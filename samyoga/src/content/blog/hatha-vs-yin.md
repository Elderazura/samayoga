You've probably heard of both Hatha and Yin yoga, but how do you know which one to choose? The answer is simpler than you might think: it depends on what you need today.

## Hatha Yoga: Active Alignment

Hatha yoga is the active practice. In a Hatha class, you'll move through poses, hold them for several breaths, and build heat in the body. The focus is on alignment, strength, and conscious movement.

**When to choose Hatha:**
- You need energy and want to feel more awake
- You want to build strength and flexibility
- Your body feels stiff and needs to move
- You want to explore your physical capabilities
- You're feeling restless and need an active practice

Hatha is yang energy—active, warming, invigorating. It's perfect for mornings, for days when you've been sedentary, or when you need to move stagnant energy.

## Yin Yoga: Receptive Release

Yin yoga is the quiet practice. In a Yin class, you'll hold poses for longer (often 3-5 minutes), with minimal effort. The focus is on releasing into the pose, letting gravity and time do the work.

**When to choose Yin:**
- You feel tense and need deep release
- Your mind is busy and you need to slow down
- You want to work with your connective tissues (ligaments, fascia)
- You're feeling depleted and need restoration
- You want to practice patience and surrender

Yin is yin energy—passive, cooling, calming. It's perfect for evenings, for days when you've been overstimulated, or when you need deep rest.

## The Complementary Practice

The beauty is that these practices complement each other perfectly. Many students find that a regular practice that includes both Hatha and Yin helps them find balance in their bodies, minds, and lives.

## Listening to Your Body

Ultimately, the best guide is your own body. Some days you'll crave movement. Other days you'll crave stillness. Trust that wisdom. Your body knows what it needs.

The practice isn't about pushing through or forcing yourself into something that doesn't feel right. It's about listening, responding, and honoring where you are—right now, in this moment.

So the next time you're choosing between Hatha and Yin, pause. Take a breath. Ask yourself: what does my body need today? And let that guide you.
